<a name=i>
<li> <h3>The number $i$</h3>

We say that "the number $i$" is the square root of negative one, or
$i=\sqrt{-1}$.
<p>
There is nothing "deep" here. It's not as if we've somehow
<i>discovered</i> what the square root of minus one is, and it turned
out to be $i$. We have simply made a <i>definition</i>. We define
a number. We name it $i$. Then we make a rule that when you square
it you get minus one. $i^2=-1$.
<p>
Note that $i$ is not a <i>variable</i> like $x$ or $y$. It is a
<i>constant</i>. It names a specific number. It just happens to be a
number that is not on "the number line."
<p>
The numbers on the number line are called the <i>real</i> numbers. Therefore,
$i$ is called an <i>imaginary</i> number. The terms "real" and "imaginary"
are unfortunate. Cows and horses are real animals. Griffins and unicorns
(so far as I know) are imaginary animals. It's not like that with "real"
and "imaginary" numbers. They are all equally real in the normal english
sense of the word. But we're stuck with these names.

<a name=defs>
<li> <h3>Basic Definitions</h3>
    <ol>
    <li> Any number on the number line is a <i>real number.</i> 
        <p>
        Examples are:
        $-100,\; -2.4,\; 0,\; 1,\; \sqrt{2},\; e,\; \pi,\; \frac{927}{13}$.

    <li> An <i>imaginary number</i> is $i$ multiplied by any real number.
        <p>
        For example: $2i$, $\frac{1}{2}i$, $(\sqrt{2})\,i$
        and $\frac{3i}{7}$ are all imaginary numbers.

    <li> A <i>complex number</i> is a number that has a real part and
        an imaginary part.
        <p>
        Here are some examples:
        <p>
        $2 + 3i$ 
        &nbsp; - the real part is $2$ and the imaginary part is $3i$.
        <p>
        $\sqrt{2}$ 
        &nbsp; - the real part is $\sqrt{2}$ and the imaginary part is $0$.
        <p>
        $i$ 
        &nbsp; - the real part is $0$ and the imaginary part is $(1)i$.
    </ol>
    As you can see, the complex numbers include the real and imaginary
    numbers. So, when we talk about "complex numbers" we are talking
    about real numbers, imaginary numbers, and numbers that are made
    up out of both real and imaginary parts.
    <p>
It is typical to refere to a complex number by the variable name $z$
and we say that: $z=a+b\,i$, where $a$ and $b$ are real. This is the same
thing as definition 3 above.
     
<a name=ops>
<li> <h3>Operations on Complex Numbers</h3>
Complex numbers have all the operations that real numbers do, including
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value,
powers, roots, and so on. In addition, they have one more operation
called: <i>conjugation</i>.
<p>
For the time being, we will only be concerned with:
<ul>
<li> Addition
<li> Subtraction
<li> Multiplication
<li> Conjugation
<li> Absolute Value (or Modulus)
<li> Division
</ul>
<p>
Addition and subtraction are easy. You just add (or subtract) the
corresponding parts of the number:
<p>
$(2+3i) + (1+2i) = (2+1) + (3i+2i) = 3+5i$
<p>
$(2+3i) - (1+2i) = (2-1) + (3i-2i) = 1+i$
<p>
And, in general:
<p>
$(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+b) + (c+d)i$

<a name=mult>
<li><h3>Multiplication</h3>
Multiplying complex numbers is just like multiplying polynomials:
<p>
$(a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 + b_2 i)\\
    \;\;\;\;\;= a_1 a_2 + a_1 b_2 i + b_1 i a_2 + b_1 i\, b_2 i
    \;\;\;\;\text{(multiply out all the terms)}\\
    \;\;\;\;\;= a_1 a_2 + a_1 b_2 i + a_2 b_1 i + b_1 b_2 i^2
    \;\;\;\;\text{(rearrange things a bit)}\\
    \;\;\;\;\;= a_1 a_2 + a_1 b_2 i + a_2 b_1 i - b_1 b_2 
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\text{(i squared is -1)}\\
    \;\;\;\;\;= (a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2) + (a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1) i
    \;\;\;\text{(gather real and imag parts together)}\\
$
<p>
Here are some examples. See if you can get the same results.
<p>
$(1+i)(2+3i)=-1+5i$
<p>
$(2+3i)(3+2i)=13i$
<p>
$\left(\frac{1}{2}i\right)(1-i)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i}{2}$


<a name=conj>
<li><h3>Conjugation</h3>

If we have a complex number: $a+bi$ then the <i>complex conjugate</i>
of that number is: $a-bi$. In other words, we simply "flip the sign"
of the imaginary part. Complex conjugation is denoted in some books
by a "*" and in other books by a bar over the number.
<p>
Let $z = a+bi$, then:
<p>
$z^* = (a+bi)^* = a-bi$
<p>
$\bar{z} = \overline{a+bi} = a-bi$
<p>
I will most likely use the *. Here are some examples:
<p>
$z=1+i$, &nbsp; $z^*=1-i$
<p>
$z=-5+\sqrt{2}\,i$, &nbsp; $z^*=-5-\sqrt{2}\,i$
<p>
$z=-5i$, &nbsp; $z^*=5i$

<a name=abs>
<li><h3>Absolute Value or Modulus</h3>
The <i>absolute value</i> of a complex number is "the square root of
the number times its conjugate."
<p>
$|z| = \sqrt{zz^*}$
<p>
If $z = a+bi$, then: $ |z| = |a+bi| = \sqrt{(a+bi)(a-bi)}
    = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}\;\; \text{(work it out!)}$

<p>
Just like the absolute value of a real number or a vector, <i>the absolute
value of a complex number is always a postitive real number.</i>
<p>
Terminology note: As the absolute value of a vector is somtimes called
a "norm" the absolute value of a complex number is sometimes called a
"modulus". The only reason you need to know about the terms "norm" and
"modulus" is that you may run into them in books or papers. It's OK just
to think of all these things as "absolute values."

<a name=div>
<li><h3>Division</h3>
The best way to deal with division of complex numbers is to "rationalize"
the denominator. This can be done by multiplying both the numerator and
denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
<p>
If I tell you to divide $3+2i$ by $1+i$, then that means you have the
fraction:
<p>
<font size=5>$\frac{3+2i}{1+i}$</font>
<p>
The denominator is $1+i$ and its conjugate is $1-i$. So, you multiply
both the numerator an denominator by $1-i$.
<p>
<font size=5>$\frac{3+2i}{1+i}\frac{1-i}{1-i}$</font>
<p>
Note that, since you are actually multiplying the original fraction by
1, you are not changing its value. You're just putting it in a different
form.
<p>
<font size=5>$\frac{3+2i}{1+i}\frac{1-i}{1-i}
    = \frac{(3+2i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}
    = \frac{5-i}{2} = \frac{5}{2}-\frac{1}{2}i
$</font>
