This is an animation of the relativistic "twins" scenario.
One twin stays on Earth. The other travels away at a high rate of velocity
and then comes back.
<p>
Typically when you see this situation analyzed in a textbook, they have
the traveling twin doing something like going out at half the speed of
light then instantaneously changing direction and coming back in at
the same speed. They then proceed to use the two different
frames of reference (going out and coming back in) to show that the
traveling twin ages less than the one who sayed at home.
<p>
I wanted to try to model a more "realistic" scenario. One that could,
at least in principle, actually happen. So what I've done here is to
have the traveling twin accelerate out at 1 Earth gravity for half
the "out" trip. Then the traveller decelerates at 1g for the other
half of the way out, coming to a stop at the outward point. This 1g
acceleration and deceleration if the repeated on the way back home.
<p>
So, instead of two frames of reference, we are "integrating over an
infinite number of frames." Of course, this is actually a numeric
simulation and approximates the situation with a finite number of
calculations.
<p>
The green "grid" lines represent the space and time coordinate systems
of the traveling twin, as seen in the Earth frame. Note that, as the traveller
"approaches" the speed of light, it's not possible to draw "enough" grid lines.
