<h2>Supplementary Notes - 27 Jan 2014</h2>

Here's some review of what we talked about on Sunday, and some new
stuff that goes with it. Basically, I want to make sure we are clear
on the following concepts:
<ol>
<li> <a href="#space">Vector Spaces</a>
<li> <a href="#dim">Dimension</a>
<li> <a href="#comb">Linear Combination</a>
<li> <a href="#ind">Linear Independence</a>
<li> <a href="#base">Bases and Basis Vectors</a>
<li> <a href="#on">Orthonormality</a>
<li> <a href="#proj">Projection</a>
<li> <a href="#change">Change of Basis</a>
</ol>

<ol>
<a name=space>
<li> <h3>Vector Spaces</h3>
    A vector space is "an abstract mathematical space in which all of
    the vectors we're talking about live." For example,
    when we draw the x/y coordinate system on the board, the "all the
    vectors we're talking about" are the arrows that can be drawn
    (starting from the origin) on the board. The vector space they
    "live" in is the 2-D plane. When we talk about "regular old" 3
    dimensional space, then "all the vectors" are any arrow that you
    can draw in that space. So, for "real" spaces like this, the
    vector space is just a mathematical representation of the physical
    space. <i>Later</i> we will encounter other kinds of vector spaces,
    but that's enough for now.

<a name=dim>
<li> <h3>Dimension</h3>
    A vector space has a dimension, and an individual vector has a dimension.
    The dimension of a vector is the <i>same</i> as the dimension of the space
    that it lives in. You could think of the dimension as any of the following:
    <ul>
    <li> The number of elements in the vector.
    <li> The number of physical dimensions of the space (if it's a physical
        space).
    <li> The number of basis vectors necessary to specify a basis for
        the space.
    </ul>
    All three of the above are equivalent.

<a name=comb>
<li> <h3>Linear Combination</h3>
    (I don't believe we covered this before.)
    <p>
    A <i>linear combination</i> of vectors is simply something like this:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $a| v_1\rangle + b| v_2\rangle +c| v_3\rangle$
    <p>
    where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are <i>scalars</i> (which means they're just
    regular numbers, not vectors). In other words, a linear combination
    of vectors is just a bunch of vectors multiplied by something and
    added together. The only reason you need to know this is because the
    term "linear combination" is used all over the place.

<a name=ind>
<li> <h3>Linear Independence</h3>
    (I don't believe we covered this before.)
    <p>
    A vector $|v_1\rangle$ is <i>linearly independent</i> of the vectors
    $|v_2\rangle$ and $|v_3\rangle$ if there is no possible linear combination
    such that:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $| v_1\rangle = a| v_2\rangle +b| v_3\rangle$
    <p>
    A couple of examples:
    <p>
    (1) Draw the vector (1 0) on a piece of paper. (The arrow from the
        origin the the point 1 on the x-axis.) Then draw the vector
        (2 3) (The arrow going to the point x=2, y=3.) The vector (2 3)
        is linearly independent of the vector (1 0) because there is nothing
        you can multipy (1 0) by to get (2 3).
    <p>
    (2) Now add the vector (0 1) to the drawing (the arrow going straight
        up the y-axis). The vector (2 3) is <i>not</i> linearly independent
        of (1 0) and (0 1) together because you can add them together in
        a linear combination to get (2 3):
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (2 3) = 2(1 0) + 3(0 1)

<a name=base>
<li> <h3>Bases and Basis Vectors</h3>
    A <i>basis</i> for a given vector space is a <i>set</i> of vectors which
    can be used, in a linear combination, to make up <i>any</i> vector in
    the space. In other words, there are no vectors in the space which are
    linearly independent of the (full set of) basis vectors.
    <p>
    Typically, a vector space will have an infinite number of different
    <i>bases</i> that you can choose from. There is often one "obvious"
    basis, such as the two vectors (1 0) and (0 1) in the 2-D plane.

<a name=on>
<li> <h3>Orthonormality</h3>
    Two vectors are <i>orthogonal</i> to one another if their inner product
    is zero. That is, $| v\rangle$ and $| w\rangle$ are orthogonal
    if:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     $\langle v| w\rangle$ = $\langle w| v\rangle$ = 0
    <p>
    In a physical space, two orthogonal vectors have a $90^\circ$
    angle between them.
    <p>
    A vector can be called either <i>normal</i> or <i>normalized</i>
    if its length is 1.
    <p>
    A basis is <i>orthonormal</i> if all the basis vectors are normalized and
    each basis vector is orthogonal to every other basis vector.

I realize that we haven't covered the next two topics at all, yet. here's
a quick look at projection and change of basis. We'll talk about them in
as much detail as needed, next Sunday. I think it would be good to cover
these before going on to matrices.
</b></font>
<hr>

<a name=proj>
<li> <h3>Projection</h3>
    <p>
    A vector can be thought of as a list of <i>components</i>. For example
    the vector (a b c) has the three components: "a", "b", and "c."
    Each component is simply a multiplier for one of the basis vectors.
    for example, take the vector: (2 3) on the 2-D plane. This vector
    is a linear combination of the basis vectors (1 0) and (0 1):
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (2 3) = 2(1 0) + 3(0 1)
    <p>
    The "2" is just the multiplier for the first basis vector and the
    "3" is the multiplier for the 2nd. If you "carry out the operations"
    from the formula above, it will go like this:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (2 3) = 2(1 0) + 3(0 1) = (2 0) + (0 3) = (2 3)
    <p>
    Another way to look at this is that the "2" is the <i>projection</i>
    of (2 3) on to the x-axis and the "3" is the projection on to the
    y-axis. In this case "projection" just means drawing a line straight
    over from the head of the vector to the axis of interest.
    <p>
    If you have a vector $|v\rangle$ and a basis vector $|b\rangle$,
    then you can obtain the projection of $|v\rangle$ onto $|b\rangle$
    by using the inner product, like this:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (the projection) = $\langle b| v\rangle$
    <p>
    The projection gives you one of the components of  $|v\rangle$.
    <p>
    So let's go all through this with the basis vectors (1 0) and (0 1)
    and the vector (2 3). As you've noticed, it's not always convenient
    to create column vectors when you're typing. So I'm just specifying
    all the vectors in row format. But if I put them in a ket, then they're
    a column and if I put them in a bra, then they're a row. So, let's
    proceed ...
    <p>
    The <i>basis</i> consists of two vectors:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $b_1$ = (1 0) and $b_2$ = (0 1)
    <p>
    And the vector of interest is:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $v$ = (2 3)
    <p>
    We find the first <i>component</i> of $v$ by projecting it onto
    the first basis vector:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $\langle b_1| v\rangle$ = 2
    <p>
    And the 2nd component by projecting it onto the 2nd basis vector:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $\langle b_2| v\rangle$ = 3
    <p>
    Obviously, I'm not actually writing out all the steps here, so
    <i>please actually work out the two inner products above.</i>
    
<a name=change>
<li> <h3>Change of Basis</h3>
    <p>
    The inner products in the last section were really trivial, and
    might have seemed pointless. But this becomes more interesting when you
    want to change from one basis to another. I'm not going to try to
    write about this in detail here, but I'll give a short explanation.
    Try it out, if you can. In any event, we'll discuss it in detail on
    the board.
    <p>
    Another possible basis for the 2-D plane is the set of vectors:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $b_1= (1/\sqrt{2},\;\; 1/\sqrt{2})$ and $b_2=(1/\sqrt{2},\;\; -1/\sqrt{2})$.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (I put in the commas here just to make things more clear. )
    <p>
    In case you don't recognize them, these were the "blue" basis vectors
    from last Sunday. Suppose that we want to "change to the blue basis."
    We can get the two components of the vector $v$ = (2 3) in the new basis
    by doing the two projections:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $\langle b_1| v\rangle = 5/\sqrt{2}$
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $\langle b_2| v\rangle = -1/\sqrt{2}$
    <p>
    This means that, in the "blue" basis, the vector $v$ would be
    $\left(\frac{5}{\sqrt{2}},\;\;\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$.
    <p>
    Or, equivalently, it means that we know how to construct $v$ out
    of the "blue" basis vectors by doing the following linear combination:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $v =
    \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
    +\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\;\; \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
    $
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $
    = \left(\frac{5}{2},\;\; \frac{5}{2}\right)
    +\left(\frac{-1}{2},\;\; \frac{1}{2}\right)
    $
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $= \left(\frac{4}{2},\;\; \frac{6}{2}\right)$
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $= \left(2,\;\; 3\right)$
    <p>
    OK, I <i>really</i> hope I didn't make any arithmetic errors! Unless
    everything that's happened so far is completely clear to you, you should
    probably stop now. If you <i>are</i> able to reproduce all the calculations
    above, then here is one more thing. The general formula for the
    calculation of an arbitrary vector's components in an arbitrary basis ...
    <p>
    Given that we have the basis: $\{b_n\}$ (meaning that we have a basis made
    out of the set of basis vectors: $b_1, b_2,$ ... and so on), then the
    $n$th component of $v$ is:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $v_n = \langle b_n | v\rangle$
    <p>
    and the entire vector $v$ is simply the sum of all those
    components times the corresponding basis vectors:
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    $v = \displaystyle\sum_{n} \langle b_n | v\rangle | b_n\rangle$
    <p>
    This formula is one that you will see often in, for example,
    quantum computing textbooks.
