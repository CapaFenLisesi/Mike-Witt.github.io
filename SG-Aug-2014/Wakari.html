<li> Go to: <a href="http://wakari.io">wakari.io</a> and make
    a "free" type account. You will get an email with a link that you
    have to click on in order to confirm the account.
<p>
<li> Once your account is set up, go to: <a href=
    "https://www.wakari.io/mike97214">wakari.io/mike97214</a> 
<p>
<li> There you should see a "Shared Bundle list." Click on the
    one you want.
<p>
<li> The next page that comes up, ignore all the warnings and click
    on the big green button that says "Run/Edit this Notebook"
<p>
<li> Then, after a bit, you should see a box that says "Fetch a bundle"
    at the top. Click the blue "Fetch" button underneath.
<p>
<li> It will do some stuff for a while, and then you'll have a screen
    that shows something called a "notebook" which takes up most of
    the display (on the right) and a narrow strip on the left that
    shows a list of notebooks (that end with ".ipynb") and other files.
<p>
<li> You can work with whatever notebook is already loaded on the right,
    or you can load another one by double clicking on its name, on the left.
</ol>
