This is an animation of the "probability wave" for the Finite Step
problem, as described in a typical undergraduate quantum mechanics
textbook.
<ul>
<li> The solid grey block represents the potential step.
<li> The green curve is calculated by a finite step (numerical) algorithm.
<li> The black dots are the anyalytical solution.
</ul>
The point of this is to gain confidence in both solutions, by animating
them over time to see of they appear to be the same.
