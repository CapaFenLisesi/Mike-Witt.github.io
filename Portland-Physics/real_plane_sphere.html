On the left is the (2D real part) of the mathematical model. On the right
is the 3D physical spin vector (sometimes called a "Bloch sphere).
<ul>
<li> The moving green vector in the sphere is the physical spin vector
    that corresponds to the moving state vector in the mathematical space on
    the left.
<li> Note that for any spin state $|\psi\rangle$ the state vector
    $-|\psi\rangle$ will correspond to the the same physical spin vector
    as $|\psi\rangle$
<li> Therefore, the the physical vector goes all the way around twice, for
     every one time the state vector goes around.
</ul>
