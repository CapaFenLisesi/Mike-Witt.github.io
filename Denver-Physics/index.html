<h2>Denver Physics Study Group</h2>
[ <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Physics-Philosophy-Meetup">
    Link to the associated "Meetup" group</a> ]
<p>

<p>

What I originally had in mind here was a discussion group dedicated to the "philosophical foundations" of various areas in physics. Topics might include, for example, the "ontological status of the wave function" or the "measurement problem" in quantum theory. This kind of discussion requires serious knowledge of mathematics and physics, and at least some familiarity with the technical terminology used by philosophers of science.
<p>
It turned out that quite a few people simply wanted to have a forum for discussing and learning a bit more about physics per se. Apparently there is currently no other group in the area that serves this purpose. That's why I changed the name to the more generic "Denver Physics Study Group."

More on this at the bottom of the page ...</a>
<p>
<b>I'm not actually in Denver yet. I'll be relocating there, hopefully before too long. I went ahead and set the group up in hopes of getting something organized in advance.</b>
<p>
I'm asking everyone to <b>please send me an email -- before you push the "join" button</b> -- with some minimal information about your background or interests in physics, or at least some indication about why you're interested in the group.
<p>
My email account is at <b>gmail.com</b> and my user name is <b>msg2mw</b>

Thanks!

More details ...
<p>
My main personal interest is in the interpretation
(what the theories are telling us about "reality") of quantum theory
and relativistic physics. I certainly won't try to
restrict discussion to my personal favorites.
I will however, outline some of
the questions I'm interested in, as best I understand them.

<h3>Questions</h3>
<h4>The ontological status the quantum state</h4>
    Does the quantum state (sometimes called the "wave function")
    represent something in the "real" world? Or is it just
    a calculational tool or a "measure of our ignorance" about
    ... something? Another way to ask this question would be:
    What <i>is</i> a superposition really? Note that <i>every</i>
    state is a superposition in <i>some</i> basis.
<p>
    (Need resources)

<h4>The measurement problem</h4>
    (Non-relativistic) quantum mechanics provides a continuous,
    deterministic formula for the evolution of a quantum state, via
    the Schroedinger equation. Until a "measurement" happens. Then
    everything changes. But there is no general agreement on when or
    how a measurement occurs. In fact many people suspect that
    a "state changing" measurement is a fiction. Many of the various
    "interpretations" of QM are the result of trying to solve this
    problem in various ways.
<p>
    (Need resources)

<h4>Locality</h4>
    Did John Bell "prove" that quantum physics is non-local, therefore
    the world is non-local? Or did he rather show that if we try to
    <i>replace</i> quantum theory with a classical theory, then <i>
    that classical theory</i> must be non-local? Does this just turn
    out to be a disagreement about the definition of "locality" or
    is there a deeper debate happening?
    <p>
    Resources for the "locality" question
    <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem">
        Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Bell's Theorem</a>
        <br>Pro non-locality?
    <li> <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bell%27s_theorem">
        Scholarpedia - Bell's theorem</a>
    <li> <a href=
        "http://media.physics.harvard.edu/video/?id=SidneyColeman_QMIYF">
        Sidney Coleman's "Quantum Mechanics in Your Face" video</a>
        <br>I believe this one is clearly taking a position
        "against non-locality."

<h3>General Physics Discussion/Study Group</h3>
</center>
<hr>
As I mentioned above, as soon as I started the "Philosophy of Physics"
group I started hearing from people who didn't have all that much background
in math or physics but were interested in learning more about it. For people
who didn't major in a scientific discipline in school, but are genuinely
interested, I guess there's no clear path to getting any "serious"
information about many of the interesting things currently going on
in physics.
<p>
It seems that there may be a need for a middle ground between reading
popular physics books (arguably ineffective) and going "back to school"
to take the required math and physics classes (arguably impractical).
<p>
The irony of the situation is that <i>it is possible</i> to learn quite
a bit, for example to gain a really basic (but correct and quantitative)
understanding of, say, quantum theory and special relativity -- without
spending years at it. It is my believe that anyone who has a good grasp
of high school algebra can get to "square one" in these subjects with
about 6 months of study (say 5 or 6 hours a week).
<p>
Maybe one of the things we can do in this group is to make people aware
of what resources there are for doing this, and let people who have some
knowledge do a bit of mentoring for people who are interested in learning.
