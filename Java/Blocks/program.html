<h2>Blocks Program Documentation - Internal Release 0.1</h2>
<hr>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
This document provides information about the implementation of the blocks
program. The flow of this document roughly follows that of the Design
Documentation. So you might be able to read a section in the design
document and then look here to see how the function is implemented.
<p>
<b>Overview</b>
<p>
The Blocks system is implemented in the Java programing language. It is
currently being developed in a Linux environment, using a Unix "makefile."
<p>
<b>Directory Structure</b>
<p>
The directory structure looks like this:
<pre>
/home/mike/Projects/Evolution/Blocks

  This is the main blocks program directory. It contains the following
  subdirectories: 

  Attributes    - Contains Java code specific to a particular type
                  of block "decision making."

  Networks      - Contains code for things like running different
                  kinds of "weighted" networks. Will probably be moved
                  out of the blocks directory structure at some point.

  Documentation - This is where all the documentation is. There are
                  subdirectories for each Version of the system.

  Versions      - This contains snapshots of different versions of the
                  system. The idea is that a "version" contains everything
                  you would need to re-build that specific version of
                  the code. Including all the required files from *outside*
                  the blocks system proper.

/home/mike/Projects/Java

  This directory contains libraries that are used in the blocks system as
  well as elsewhere.
</pre>
<p>
The main Blocks directory contains the makefile and various ancillary files,
scripts, and so on. But mainly it is intended to contain all the java code
that is both unique to the Blocks system and common to all "versions" of
blocks.
<p>
Code that is related to a particular type of decision making should be kept
in the Attribute subdirectory. Code that is not unique to the Blocks program
should be in some other subdirectory. (An example of this is the Networks
subdirectory. This contains code that is actually general purpose, and will
probably be moved completely out of the Blocks directory structure at some
point.)
<p>
<b>Build Process</b>
<p>
Typing: <i>make all</i> in the main blocks directory should completely
rebuild blocks and any other related programs. Programs end up being .jar
files. So, for example, you end up with a file called "blocks.jar" as a
result of the build. This file would be run by saying: <i>java -jar 
blocks.jar</i>
<p>
Before the jar file is created, a copies of <i>all</i> classes used are
placed in the main blocks directory. They are added to the jar file from
there. So, there is no directory hierarchy within the jar file, and no
classpath statements needed.

<b>Basic System Objects</b>
<p>
TBD
<p>
<b>Starting and Stopping the World</b>
<p>
<img src="WorldRunStates.png">

Above is a diagram of the World's run states. There are potential race
condintions when other threads (like the CommandWindow) start and stop
the world. The methods startWorld(), stepWorld(), and stopWorld() are
used to transition the world between states. Whenever you use one of
these methods, wait until the world's getRunState() method indicates
that the world has completed the transition, before executing any logic
that assumes the world has reached the desired state.

<b>Turns and Moves</b>

TBD

<b>Decision Making vs Basic Constraints</b>

TBD

<b>The Decision Making Process</b>
<p>
The decision making process is always located in the "DecisionProcedure"
object. Currently I am working on a subclass of DecisionProcedure called
DP4, which will implement the process described in the related section
of the Design Documenation. Here is how it works:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <i>Look at any other blocks that I'm in physical contact with, and decide
     which (if any) of them looks the most "interesting."</i>
	<p>
	Implementation TBD.
	<p>
<li> <i>Decide what action I want to take with regard to the "interesting" 
     block. Possibilities are: Move away from it, fight with it, try
     to eat it, or do nothing</i>
	<p>
	Implementation TBD.
	<p>
<li> <i>If no blocks were touching me, or if none of them was interesting, then
     examine all the block in my field of vision to see if any of them is
     interesting.</i>
	<p>
	Implementation TBD.
	<p>
<li> <i>If so, decide on an action for that block. Possibilities are: Move
     toward it, move away from it, or do nothing.</i>
	<p>
	Implementation TBD.
	<p>
<li> If I didn't discover anything to do with any other block, then decide
     if I want to do some "other" action. Possibilites are: random move,
     divide, or ?</i>
	<p>
	Implementation TBD.
</ol>
