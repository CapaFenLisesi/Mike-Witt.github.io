<h2>Blocks Design Documentation - Internal Release 0.1</h2>
<hr>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
This document ...
<p>
<b>Overview</b>
<p>
Blocks is an "evolutionary simulation." It consists of a "world", simulated
on the computer, which is populated with artificial creatures (replicators)
called "blocks" (because they appear as little squares on the screen.)
<p>
Blocks are like simple one celled organisms.  They move around in their 
simulated world, sometimes eating each other and reproducing by a process
of division. They eventually die. They have certain characteristics or 
"attributes" which determine how
they act. These attributes might cause them to live longer and reproduce
more, or die quickly - perhaps not reproducing at all.
<p>
When blocks divide, giving birth to a new block, random mutations can
happen to the block's attributes. These mutations could make the new block
more or less "fit" in terms longevity and reproduction. The idea is that we
would expect to see the block attributes "evolving" over time, based on
a process of selection.

<b>The Decision Making Process</b>
<p>
Each time a block gets to move, it goes through a decision process something
like this:
<ol>
<li> Look at any other blocks that I'm in physical contact with, and decide
	 which (if any) of them looks the most "interesting."
<li> Decide what action I want to take with regard to the "interesting" 
	 block. Possibilities are: Move away from it, fight with it, try
	 to eat it, or do nothing.
<li> If no blocks were touching me, or if none of them was interesting, then
	 examine all the block in my field of vision to see if any of them is
	 interesting.
<li> If so, decide on an action for that block. Possibilities are: Move
	 toward it, move away from it, or do nothing.
<li> If I didn't discover anything to do with any other block, then decide
	 if I want to do some "other" action. Possibilites are: random move,
	 divide, or ?
</ol>
