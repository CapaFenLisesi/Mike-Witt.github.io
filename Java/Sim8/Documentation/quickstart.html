<h2>Sim8 Quick Start Guide</h2>
<p>
This sections gives a brief outline of how to download, install, and
run the Sim8 microcomputer simulation. For more detailed information on
the use of Sim8, see the <a href="index.html">documentation index.</a>
<p>
<b>Step1: Install Java on your computer</b>
<p>
In order to run Sim8 you need to have the Java runtime environment installed
on your computer. This guide does not explain how to download and install
Java.
<p>
<b>Step2: Download the Sim8 software</b>
<p>
Get one of these files:
<ul>
<li> <a href="../Sim8.jar">Sim8.jar</a>
<li> <a href="../Sim8-13Feb2002.tar">Sim8-13Feb2002.tar</a>
<li> <a href="../Sim8-13Feb2002.zip">Sim8-13Feb2002.zip</a>
</ul>

If you have any trouble
<a href="../../../contact.html">let me know.</a>
<p>
<b>Step3: Run the simulator and load a program</b>
<ul>
<li> Go into the directory Sim8 was installed in
<p>
<li> Type: java -jar Sim8.jar
	<p>
	This will bring up the main Sim8 "Console" on your screen. The console
	contains a display of all the CPU registers, and it has several buttons
	on it, including buttons that say "Power", "Load", and "Run." Near the
	top of the console are two menus labeled "Settings" and "Information."
<p>
<li> Press the "Power" button to turn the computer on.
<p>
<li> Go to the "settings" menu and within that to the "memory" submenu.
	Choose the "Show Window" item. The "Sim8 Memory" window should appear.
	This window shows all 256 memory locations. The default display is
	in Hex, but you can change it to Decimal or Binary by doing:<br>
		Settings->Memory->Display in Decimal (for example.)
	<p>
	Notice that all memory locations start out as zero.
<p>
<li> Press the "Load" button. This will bring up a file chooser dialog.
	You should see the files in the "Programs" directory. Among these
	should be a file called "count.ldf"  Select this file and load it
	by pressing the "OK" button. Note that the first several locations
	of memory have changed to the values of the loaded program.
<p>
<li> View the "count.ldf" file using the editor of your choice. It should
	look something like this:
<pre>
# This program counts from 1 to 10
!locdec
!valbin
#       lda     0
000:00011100
001:00000000
#loop   add     1
002:00111100
003:00000001
#       out
004:11110001
#       cmp     10
005:10101100
006:00001010
#       jlt     loop
007:00001101
008:00000010
#       halt
009:11111111
</pre>

	Some comments about the load file format: First, any lines that start
	with the "#" character are treated as comments by the loader. The comments
	in the file above contain "mnemonic" representations of the machine	
	language instructions, i.e. assembly language. 
	<p>
	The lines that have the form "number:number" provide the data which is
	actually loaded into Sim8 memory. The number before the ":" is the 
	memory location which is to be loaded. The number after the ":" is
	the value which is to be loaded into that location.
	<p>
	The line "!locdec" tells the loader that the location field in this
	load file is specified in decimal. The "!valbin" line indicates that
	the value field is binary. It's convenient to specify machine language
	instructions in binary because it makes it easy to encode and decode
	the various bit fields.
<p>
<li> Now go back to the Menus and do: Settings->Output->Show Window<br>
	This should display the "Output" window. 
<p>
<li> Then press the "Run" button. You should see the program count from
	"01" to "0a" in the output window. The default displays are all in
	hex. If you would rather see the output in decimal, do:<br>
	Settings->Output->Display in Decimal.
<p>
<li> If you want to re-run the program, you need to press the "Reset"
	button first, so set the program counter back to zero. Pressing reset
	clears all the registers. Turning "Power" off and on clears everything
	including zeroing out any programs loaded into memory.
<p>
<li> If you are having problems, do: Settings->Debug Window->Show Window<br>
	This will bring up a window which displays error messages.
<ul>
