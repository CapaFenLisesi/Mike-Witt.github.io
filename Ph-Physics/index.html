<h2>Philosophy of Physics</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

I'm trying to start a group to discuss foundational questions in
various areas in physics.
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Denver-Physics-Philosophy-Meetup">
    Here is a link to the associated "Meetup" group.</a>
</ul>

My main personal interest is in the interpretation
(what the theories are telling us about "reality") of quantum theory
and relativistic physics. However, I have no intention of trying to
restrict discussion to my personal favorites. I will however, outline some of
these questions, as best I understand them.

<hr>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<h4>The ontological status the quantum state</h4>
    Does the quantum state (sometimes called the "wave function")
    represent something in the "real" world? Or is it just
    a calculational tool or a "measure of our ignorance" about
    ... something? Another way to ask this question would be:
    What <i>is</i> a superposition really? Note that <i>every</i>
    state is a superpostion in <i>some</i> basis.

<h4>The measurement problem</h4>
    (Non-relativistic) quantum mechanics provides a continuous,
    deterministic formula for the evolution of a quantum state, via
    the Schroedinger equation. Until a "measurement" happens. Then
    everything changes. But there is no general agreement on when or
    how a measurement occurs. In fact many people suspect that
    a "state changing" measurement is a fiction. Many of the various
    "interpretations" of QM are the result of trying to solve this
    problem in various ways.

<h4>Locality</h4>
    Did John Bell "prove" that quantum physics is non-local, therefore
    the world is non-local. Or did he rather show that if we try to
    <i>replace</i> quantum theory with a classical theory, then <i>
    that classical theory</i> must be non-local? Does this just turn
    out to be a disagreement about the definition of "locality" or
    is there a deeper debate happening?
